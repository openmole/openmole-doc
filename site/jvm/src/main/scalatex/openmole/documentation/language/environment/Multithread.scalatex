@p{Multi-threaded environment}
  By default OpenMOLE tasks run on a single thread of your local machine. To use several cores of your computer, you can
  define a so called LocalEnvironment with the number of threads to use as its parameter.
  @br @hl.openmole("""
  // Use 10 threads / cores
  val env = LocalEnvironment(10)""")
