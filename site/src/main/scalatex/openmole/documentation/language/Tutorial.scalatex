@sect{Tutorial}
  This part of the documentation exposes tutorials handling certain use cases of OpenMOLE. Don't focus too much on the
  applications or programming languages serving as a use case. These tutorials are more about how to do things
  the OpenMOLE way. You can discover how to:
  @ul
    @li{@a("Get started with OpenMOLE and a simple workflow", href := DocumentationPages.root.tutorial.helloWorld.file)}
    @li{@a("Build a headless version of you NetLogo model to integrate in into OpenMOLE",
    href := DocumentationPages.root.tutorial.headlessNetLogo.file)}
    @li{@a("Calibrate a NetLogo model using genetic algorithms", href := DocumentationPages.root.tutorial.netLogoGA.file)}
    @li{@a("Use advanced features of Capsules", href := DocumentationPages.root.tutorial.capsule.file)}

  @p Feel free to suggest new tutorial on topics you'd like us to describe more thoroughly. You can even write your own
  and share it with the OpenMOLE community on the @a("wiki", href := "https://github.com/openmole/openmole/wiki")! We'll
  make sure to integrate it in the next release.
